STATUS SUMMARY
--------------
What's in:
* Playback control, station selection and management, QuickMix control,
  upcoming playlist/queue, previously played/history, skip limiting,
  seed & rating management, audio quality control, connection and
  Pandora account settings, manual page, user management, user
  station preferences & automatic station selection ("autotuning").
* piano shell script for control and command-line access
* Good stability/reliability on OS X and Linux.
* runmix pleasantly functional; may need some portability work.
* Recognizes startup as root, uses files from /etc and drops root
  priviliges to improve security.

Caveats:
* Occasional playback stalls at the start of a song on OS X/PPC.
  It looks like the player thread is stuck on a mutex in libao.
 
FUTURE ROADMAP
--------------
Features planned:
* None.  It's done!
